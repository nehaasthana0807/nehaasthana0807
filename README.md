- 👋 Hi, I’m @nehaasthana0807 I am a pure spirit and I mostly get intrigued with the miracles of nature. Aim of my life is to become same as the meaning of my name that is pure unconditional love. I truly believe that love is patient and kind and love is love no matter what form it appears in...
- 👀 I’m an Automation expert and code critic. I believe QAs are more sort of quality culture awareness creators/influencers. Our job is more than what it seems. Repeat after me, QA do not write test cases already written by developers! They setup experiments and outcomes may not be firstly understood but eventually you will see value of it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript because I am interested to implement Playwright automation testing framework in my current area of work. I have participated in Code Gladiators recently and finished Masters from IIT Roorkee with specialization in Machine Learning. Someday I want to apply these skills into codeless intelligent testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python automation projects.

A poem to honour what I do!

Testing software is an art,
A craft that takes a patient heart.
Each line of code must be inspected,
For every bug, we must be detected.

First, we must plan our every test,
To ensure our code is at its best.
Test cases must be well-defined,
To leave no room for the undefined.

Functional testing is a must,
To check if our code is just.
Does it do what it's meant to do?
Or does it need more work, anew?

Performance testing is also key,
To ensure our code runs seamlessly.
It must handle the load we expect,
And not break down with a defect.

Security testing must be done,
To protect our code from any con.
It must be safe from outside harm,
And keep our users free from alarm.

Regression testing is a must,
To ensure our changes don't cause a bust.
We must test again and again,
To catch any bugs, now or then.

And so we test with all our might,
To ensure our code is error-free and bright.
Each test we run, we learn and grow,
And make our software better, we know.
